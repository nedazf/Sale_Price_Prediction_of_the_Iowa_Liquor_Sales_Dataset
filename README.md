## Plots with interesting results
vendor_profit_loss.png : here, we expected that majority of vendors will be in profit but from the available data we can only analyize that majority of them are in loss.  
salebyweekay.png : in this figure we expected the figures to go up during weekend but sales were up on week days that is on Monday and Wednesday   
income-expenditure.png : it was surprising to know that people with high income spend less on purchasing liquors while in counties with comparatively low income,
more money was spent on purchasing liquor but the relation could not be generalized as variation existed in both       
sale_population_relation.png : sale and population had directly proportional relation no variations were observed.      
corrplot.png: shows the Pearson correlation coefficient of various features.
